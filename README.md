# Part I - Introduction to Java Threads
As reviewed in the readings, complete the CountThread classes, so that they define the life cycle of a thread that prints the numbers between A and B. 

Complete the main method of the CountMainThreads class so that: 

Create 3 threads of type CountThread, assigning the first one the interval [0..99], the second one [99..199], and the third one [200..299]. 

Start all three threads with start(). 

Run and check the output on screen. 

Change the beginning with start() to run(). How does the output change? Why?
